### Examples:
polyhedrons_0 - Example of instantiating Dodecahedron class

polyhedrons_1 - Example of creating multiple instances of Dodecahedron randomly on screen

polyhedrons_2 - Example using left/right arrow keys to cycle through all polyhedrons in the library

polyhedrons_3 - Example of first four stellations of the dodecahedron rotating around a sphere with the ability to click and add more instances

Feel free to add more polyhedrons, update my most likely sloppy code or anything else you think may make this better!
